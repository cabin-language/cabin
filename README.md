# Cabin

**Warning: Cabin is in pre-alpha. It is still in active development and *won't* work, not even for small or experimental projects. Note that items that are not checked off are either currently unfinished or not even started.**

A dead simple, highly performant, extremely safe programming language.

## Installation

**Please read the `## Syntax Gotchas` section under `# Limitations` before using Cabin to avoid confusion.**

Cabin is not yet available for installation, because it's *that* early on. It will release in 0.1 for alpha testing.

## Philosophy & Motivation

Cabin has three "core values":

- Simplicity
- Safety
- Performance

Above all else, Cabin aims to be a dead simple language that anyone can learn in almost no time, while not compromising on performance or safety.

Cabin aims to fill the "missing hole" in the intersection of these three values:

![motivation](./docs/motivation.png)

There are other attempts to fill this hole as well, such as Nim and V. This is just one of them.

Cabin is primarily inspired by Lua, Rust, Go, and Zig, except it aims to be type-safer than Lua, simpler than Rust, faster than Go, and memory-safer than Zig. That is the niche Cabin aims to fill.

There will never be a Cabin 2.0; In fact, there will never even be a Cabin 1.1. Once the features of the language are added and 1.0 is released, Cabin will only change for bugfixes from then on. No new syntax, no changes to the standard library.

## Niceties

Cabin has several features that make it attractive. Below are just some examples.

### Detailed and Readable errors

Cabin generates very detailed and human-readable errors at the command line. Here's an extreme example with all verbosity and debug information enabled:

![errors](/docs/errors.png)

Cabin does allow, through flags, more "structured" errors &mdash; i.e., errors printed in formats like JSON or TOML. This is mainly used for IDEs and linters to integrate Cabin errors as diagnostics. The default formatting mode is human readable, which will output what you can see above.

### Thoughtless Memory Management Without Garbage Collection

Cabin provides no memory semantics to the developer. That is, memory is not manually managed through things like `malloc` or `free`, there are no ownership or borrowing semantics, etc. However, Cabin **is not garbage collected**. Cabin has its own system of determining when variables need to be cleaned up at compile-time instead of runtime. You can think of it as "compile-time garbage collection" &mdash; meaning you get the ergonomics of garbage collection without the performance hit.

### Compile-Time by default

Cabin has a unique capability to be able to run code at compile-time. However, unlike most other languages with this capability (like Zig's `comptime` or Jai's `#run`), Cabin *runs code at compile-time as the default*. What this means is that if your code *can* be run at compile-time, it will be. This means Cabin can report errors that are normally completely impossible for other languages to detect, and automatically optimizes for maximum runtime performance.

Of course, if you would like to perform an action at runtime like writing a file, you can force it with the `run` keyword, which in this case would look something like `run write_file(filename, contents)`. The run keyword forces the expression after it (but not its sub-expressions!) to be run at runtime instead of compile-time. Cabin *can* write to files at compile-time, but you probably don't want to, so this is where you'd use a `run` expression. Some functions, including `write_file`, are marked with `#[runtime_preferred]`; Calling these functions at compile-time will give a (suppressible) warning that you're calling a function at compile-time which is typically used at runtime.

You can think about "what can be run at compile-time" as a tree &mdash; The arguments passed to a Cabin program at the command-line aren't known at compile-time. The expressions that depend on those arguments are thus also not evaluated at compile-time. The expressions that depend on the results of *those* expressions are also not evaluated at compile-time, and so on. Any expression in the expression tree that doesn't rely on user input can be and will be evaluated at compile-time.

One of the nice features about Cabin's compile-time code compared to Zig's is that Cabin uses a unified API to run compile-time code and runtime code. For example, to read a file at compile-time in Zig, you use `@embedFile`, but to read a file at runtime, you do something along the lines of `try std.fs.cwd().openFile(filename, .{});` and read it with a reader from there. In Cabin, the API is the same: You do `read_file(filename)` to read a file at compile-time or runtime, which is just a regular Cabin function that, like all functions in Cabin, can be called at runtime or compile-time. This means you don't need to remember two different ways of doing the same thing.

### Safety to the Max

Cabin is designed to be extremely safe, both in memory and in types. In terms of type safety specifically, Cabin makes no compromises. In Cabin, you can't assign `null` (what we call `nothing`) to any type; You must specify that the type is a union of some other type or `nothing`. Cabin is also statically typed, so there doesn't exist any sort of "type error" or "missing property error" at runtime at all.

In fact, Cabin doesn't have runtime errors *at all*. Part of the philosophy of Cabin's functional style is that each function should be responsible for doing whatever it's job is, and when something goes wrong, it should just report that back to the caller (return an error). There is no immediate panicking or exiting the program; No one function should have the power to determine what to do with the entire program when an error is encountered; Instead, it should simply pass the error up the error stack. You can do this repeatedly for functions in functions, and only when the global scope (or "main function" if you'd like to think of it that way) encounters an error will the program actually terminate.

Furthermore, memory unsafety doesn't exist in Cabin. It's impossible to memory leak. It's impossible to have a dangling reference. No, it's not garbage collected.

## Tooling Reference

By default, the Cabin compiler comes with the following tools:

- [x] Project Creator: Creates new Cabin projects with a set up config file and source folder.
- [x] Runner: Runs Cabin code without outputting any permanent files
- [x] Project Configurer: Changes compiler options for a given project
- [ ] Compiler: Compiles Cabin code to native binary executable
- [ ] Formatter: Formats Cabin code to a single unified style
- [ ] Transpiler: Transpiles Cabin code to C
- [ ] Linter: Provides code diagnostics including errors, warnings, hints, and information.
- [ ] Package Manager: Manages Cabin dependencies, publishes cabin packages, etc.

### Runner

Using `cabin run <filename.cabin>` will run a single Cabin file. Under the hood, this transpiles the code to C, stores that in a temporary file, transpiles the C code to a native executable, stores *that* in a temporary file, then runs the native executable and removes both the files. This allows running code without having to save it anywhere in particular.

If `cabin run` is used without a file name as the argument, it will assume you are in a Cabin project, and run the project, using the configuration file (`./cabin.toml`) and using `src/main.cabin` as the main file to run.

### Configurer

Using `cabin set <option-name> <option-value>` will set a compiler option, saved to the `cabin.toml`. Compiler options are purely display features &mdash; they do **not** affect how your code is compiled.

Options:

- `quiet: boolean = false`: Prevents the compiler from emitting extra information during compilation. Only what your code prints will be printed, as well as fatal errors. Errors will have less detail provided. 
- `developer-mode: boolean = false`: Enables developer mode, which prints extra debug information and stack traces for developers of the Cabin compiler.
- `theme: "none" | "catppuccin-mocha" | "one-midnight"`: The color theme that code snippets are printed to the terminal in when an error occurs.

### Compiler

Using `cabin build <filename.cabin> <output>` will compile a single Cabin file into a native binary executable. Under the hood, this transpiles the Cabin code into C, compiles the C code into the native executable (at `<output>`), and then removes the temporary C file. If no argument is supplied for `<output>`, the default is to name the output `<filename>` (the name of the source file without `.cabin`) and place it in the same location as the source file.

If `cabin build` is used without any additional arguments, it will assume you are in a Cabin project, and build the project, using the configuration file (`./cabin.toml`) and using `src/main.cabin` as the main file to build.

### Formatter

Cabin comes with a single un-opinionated formatter built in with `cabin format <filename.cabin>`. This will format a single Cabin file. Running `cabin format` without a file argument will assume you are in a Cabin project and format all files in the project. There are *not* options that can be passed to customize formatting, and this is by design. All Cabin code looks the same.

### Transpiler

Cabin can be transpiled into C code. It won't be beautiful C code, but it is human-readable enough. This is done with `cabin transpile <filename.cabin> <output.c>`, which will transpile the code in `filename.cabin` and output the equivalent C into `<output.c>`. If no output is specified, the file will be named `filename.c` (the name of the original source file with a `.c` extension instead of `.cabin`).

### Linter

Cabin comes with a built-in linter via `cabin check`. The Cabin linter has two modes that can be changed between: Developer mode and release mode. Developer mode provides basic lints such as compiler errors. Release mode provides *exhaustive* lints for production-ready code, down to things as pedantic as missing documentation. Developer mode is the default for the linter mode, and in many IDEs and text editors, you can switch between the two modes with a keybinding. 

Options:
- `--mode` or `-m` ["develop" | "release"]: The mode to lint the project in.
- `--format` ["json" | "toml" | "yaml" | "human"] (default "human"): The format to output the results in. Passing "human" (the default) will output pretty, human-readable diagnostics. To get structured diagnostics for IDE integration, use `json`, `toml` or `yaml`.

### Package Manager

The Cabin toolchain has several commands for package management:
- `cabin add <package>` - Adds a dependency to the package.
	- `--version` or `-v` - Adds a specific version of the dependency
- `cabin remove <package>` - Removes a dependency from the package.
- `cabin publish` - Publishes a package. Options:
	- `--major` or `-M` - Increments the version number by 1.0.0 automatically
	- `--minor` or `-m` - Increments the version number by 0.1.0 automatically
	- `--patch` or `-p` - Increments the version number by 0.0.1 automatically

## Limitations

While Cabin was designed to give certain specific benefits, some of them come with drawbacks. Some are listed here.

### Syntax Gotchas

Cabin's syntax makes a few compromises to be as terse and expressive as it is. For example, when comparing things with less-than and greater-than, you must use spaces around the comparison operator:

```cabin
if a<b { ... } // Not valid
if a < b { ... } // Valid
```

While this may seem arbitrary, this is necessary to be able to distinguish what's a function call or parameterized group from a comparison. For example, consider this case:

```cabin
if a<b and c>(d) { ... }
```

this could be a function called `a`, with a compile time parameter of the expression `b and c`, and a runtime parameter `d`, or, this could be checking if `a < b` and `c > d`. This is ambiguous and the compiler has no way of knowing what you're trying to do here. So, We require that you use spaces around comparison operators and no spaces around compile-time parameters:

```cabin
foo < hi > // Not a valid function call
foo<hi> // Valid!
```

This is standard formatting anyway, but whitespace-sensitivity can definitely be confusing and a "gotcha" for some people, so it's good to make note of.

### No Caching

Your code needs to be recompiled, every time, even if it's completely unchanged. Well, not *entirely* - We can skip everything after compile-time evaluation (which is transpilation into C code and compiling the C code), but your program always needs to be re-tokenized and parsed, even if it's unchanged. Most languages can store the binary executable and check if your program is unchanged, and just rerun the executable if it is. However, in Cabin, the final binary executable doesn't contain all of the information about the program - notably compile-time code. For example, if your code prints something during compile-time, this won't be present in the final executable, and running the same code a second time would yield different results because the compile-time code won't be run and nothing will be printed. This is more confusing than caching is worth, so for now, we can't fully cache a pre-compiled program.

### User-Based Conditional Compilation

The compiled executable can be different depending on user input at compile-time. For example, you can call the `terminal.input` function at compile-time, and do something with the result at compile-time, and the resulting executable can be different for different people that compile it. For this reason, some functions such as `terminal.input` are marked with `#[runtime_only]`, which means the compiler will emit a warning if it's called at compile-time instead of runtime. However, this is only a warning, not a hard error. Part of Cabin's philosophy on being simple is to not make special exceptions, so all functions can be run at compile-time, including functions like `terminal.input`. The warning discourages but does not prevent compilation to different executables based on user input or the user's environment (such as reading a file at compile-time) during compilation. The functions where this can be problematic, like `terminal.input` and `file.read`, are marked `#[runtime_only]` to discourage running them at compile-time.

### Compilation Speed Limited by C

Currently (though maybe not forever), Cabin compiles to C before being compiled to a native binary. This means that *no matter how optimized the compiler is, it will always be at least slower than C* (at compiling). This isn't a huge deal because modern C compilers are optimized really well to be really fast, but it's worth noting that this strict lower bound currently exists, and that with the current compilation system Cabin could never beat C in this department.

# Philosophy

If it can be done readably with existing syntax, it should be.

Readable is good; traditional is not necessarily so.

Software can be complete.
