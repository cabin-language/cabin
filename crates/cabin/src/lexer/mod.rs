/// A type of token in Cabin source code. The first step in Cabin compilation is tokenization, which is the process of splitting a raw String of source code into
/// "tokens" which each have a "type" representing the kind of token it is, and a "value" representing the string of source code that is associated with it. This
/// enum defines the different "types" of values. Tokens themselves are stored in a separate `Token` struct, which has a `token_type: TokenType` field. This *is*
/// against general Rust convention, which recommends instead making `value: String` a subtype of the `TokenType` enum. However, for this specific implementation and
/// use case, we want to be able to easily iterate over all types of tokens, which means we want each type to be a "concrete object" instead of an instantiable
/// function or type. Thus, we instead make `TokenType` a field on the `Token` struct.
///
/// # Conventions
///
/// These token types are named by what the token itself appears as, not the usage in the language. For example, the "`.`" token is not called "access" or something,
/// it is just called `Dot`. The names of the tokens should be written parser-agnostic, meaning they should have no "knowledge" of the actual use cases of the
/// token in the language. This helps make parser changes easier, as we can repurpose token types without having to rename them and without causing confusion
/// or ambiguity in what they refer to.

pub enum TokenType {
	/// The "tag opening" token type. This marks the start of a list of tags on a variable declaration. Please note that this only notes the *start* of such
	/// a list, not the entire list. To be specific, this *only* matches the character sequence `#[`. All tokens after that sequenced are tokenized as normal, including
	/// the ending right bracket that tag lists conclude with. A returned token with this type will always have the value `#[`.
	TagOpening,

	/// The "asterisk" token type. This is used for parsing arithmetic multiplication expressions. Any token tokenized of this type will always have a single-character value,
	/// which is the "asterisk" character (*).
	Asterisk,

	/// The "caret" token type. This is used for parsing arithmetic exponential expressions. Any token tokenized of this type will always have a single-character value,
	/// which is the "caret" character (^).
	Caret,

	/// The "colon" token type. This is used for parsing explicit type tags on variable declarations. While Cabin does perform type inference and often allows type
	/// tags to be omitted, there are occasionally times where it's preferred or even necessary to insert a specific tag on a variable. Any token tokenized
	/// of this type will always have a single-character value, which is the "colon" character (:).
	Colon,

	/// The "comma" token type. This is used for things like function parameter separation, group field separation, etc. Any token tokenized of this type will always
	/// have a single-character value, which is the "comma" character (,).
	Comma,

	QuestionMark,
	ExclamationPoint,

	/// The double equals token type. This is used for comparisons in if statements, similar to other languages. Any token tokenized of this type will always
	/// have the value "=="
	DoubleEquals,

	/// The "dot" token type. This is used for things like function parameter separation, group field separation, etc. Any token tokenized of this type will always
	/// have a single-character value, which is the "comma" character (,).
	Dot,

	/// The "equal" token type. This is used for variable and field assignment. Any token tokenized of this type will always have a single-character value, which is
	/// the "equal" character (=).
	Equal,

	/// The "line comment" token type. This is used for comments the programmer wants to make about the code that doesn't actually affect the code at runtime.
	/// This represents the type of comment that continues until the end of the line. Currently, this is a double slash (//), but in the future will likely be
	/// changed to something more intuitive. When tokenizes, tokens of this type will return the entire comment, including the leading two slashes, but not the
	/// trailing newline or carriage return.
	///
	/// NOTE: This *must* be checked *before* the `ForwardSlash` token type. Failure to do so will start parsing a comment as two separate forward slash
	/// tokens, and then attempt to parse the comment as code. These token types are iterated with `strum::IntoEnumIterator`, which iterates over this enum
	/// in order. This means that this enum variant declaration *must* be placed *before* the `ForwardSlash` token type. Please be careful moving this variant
	/// or that one around!
	Comment,

	/// The forward slash token. This is used for arithmetic division expressions. Any token tokenized of this type will always have a single-character value, which is
	/// the "forward slash" character (/).
	ForwardSlash,

	/// The `otherwise` keyword token type. This is used similar to the "else" keyword in other languages: it runs a block of code if an `if` condition is false.
	///
	/// The design decision behind making this `otherwise` instead of `else` is that it reads more like natural English. It is less intuitive for experienced
	/// programmers, which may expect an `else` keyword to exist, but after learning it once it shouldn't be an issue.
	///
	/// Like all keywords, this enum variant declaration *must* come before `Identifier`. If it doesn't, then `otherwise` will be tokenized incorrectly as an
	/// identifier, which will cause issues when parsing. Please be careful when moving around this keyword or the `Identifier` token type!
	KeywordOtherwise,

	RightArrow,

	KeywordExtend,
	KeywordAnd,
	KeywordOr,
	KeywordToBe,

	/// The `if` keyword token type. This is used similar to how it is in other languages: It runs a block of code if some condition is true.
	///
	/// Unlike many other keywords in Cabin, this is the same as it is in almost all other languages. Generally we swap out common keywords with things
	/// we find more intuitive or "common English" sounding, but `if` already is about as colloquial as it gets.
	///
	/// Like all keywords, this enum variant declaration *must* come before `Identifier`. If it doesn't, then `if` will be tokenized incorrectly as an
	/// identifier, which will cause issues when parsing. Please be careful when moving around this keyword or the `Identifier` token type!
	KeywordIf,

	/// The `action` keyword token type. This is used to declare functions.
	///
	/// A token created with this type will always have the value "function".
	///
	/// Like all keywords, this enum variant declaration *must* come before `Identifier`. If it doesn't, then `action` will be tokenized incorrectly as
	/// identifiers, which will cause issues when parsing. Please be careful when moving around this keyword or the `Identifier` token type!
	KeywordAction,

	/// The new keyword. This is used to instantiate a table.
	///
	/// A token created with this type will always have the value "new".
	///
	/// Like all keywords, this enum variant declaration *must* come before `Identifier`. If it doesn't, then `new` will be tokenized incorrectly as
	/// identifiers, which will cause issues when parsing. Please be careful when moving around this keyword or the `Identifier` token type!
	KeywordNew,

	/// The `group` keyword token type, which is used to declare a type of group of variables in the language, analogous to a `struct` in other languages.
	///
	/// This was named `group` instead of the far more common `struct` to be consistent with Cabin's readability and "common English" aesthetics. It's named
	/// exactly what it creates: A group of values.
	///
	/// A token created with this type will always have the value "group".
	///
	/// Like all keywords, this enum variant declaration *must* come before `Identifier`. If it doesn't, then `group` will be tokenized incorrectly as
	/// identifiers, which will cause issues when parsing. Please be careful when moving around this keyword or the `Identifier` token type!
	KeywordGroup,

	KeywordIs,

	KeywordMatch,

	/// The `let` keyword token type. This is used to declare a variable.
	///
	/// A token created with this type will always have the value "let".
	///
	/// Like all keywords, this enum variant declaration *must* come before `Identifier`. If it doesn't, then `let` will be tokenized incorrectly as
	/// identifiers, which will cause issues when parsing. Please be careful when moving around this keyword or the `Identifier` token type!
	KeywordLet,

	/// The `foreach` keyword token type. This is used to iterate over a list.
	///
	/// A token created with this type will always have the value "foreach".
	///
	/// Like all keywords, this enum variant declaration *must* come before `Identifier`. If it doesn't, then `foreach` will be tokenized incorrectly as
	/// identifiers, which will cause issues when parsing. Please be careful when moving around this keyword or the `Identifier` token type!
	KeywordForEach,

	/// The `in` keyword token type. This is used to iterate over a list.
	///
	/// A token created with this type will always have the value "in".
	///
	/// Like all keywords, this enum variant declaration *must* come before `Identifier`. If it doesn't, then `in` will be tokenized incorrectly as
	/// identifiers, which will cause issues when parsing. Please be careful when moving around this keyword or the `Identifier` token type!
	KeywordIn,

	/// The `while` keyword token type. This is used to loop while some condition is true
	///
	/// A token created with this type will always have the value "while".
	///
	/// Like all keywords, this enum variant declaration *must* come before `Identifier`. If it doesn't, then `while` will be tokenized incorrectly as
	/// identifiers, which will cause issues when parsing. Please be careful when moving around this keyword or the `Identifier` token type!
	KeywordWhile,

	KeywordEither,

	/// An identifier in the language. This is essentially a "name" of a variable. Whenever the user creates a new variable with a name, it is represented with
	/// this token type.
	///
	/// Note that the token types are all checked in the order they are declared. The `Identifier` pattern **does not** take special care to not include keywords.
	/// This means that when asked, the `Identifier` token type will match keywords. This means that this variant declaration must occur *after* all keywords
	/// in the language. Please be mindful of this when moving this token type declaration around or when moving keyword token type declarations around.
	///
	/// Currently, although this may change, valid Cabin identifiers follow the following pattern:
	///
	/// ```js
	/// /[A-Za-Z_]\w*/
	/// ```
	/// without the leading and trailing slash of course. This means all identifiers must start with an alphabetical character or a underscore, and then optionally
	/// can have more characters which can be alphabetical, underscore, or a number.
	///
	/// TODO: We should consider what other symbols to allow here. Should we allow dollar signs? Why should we? Why shouldn't we? What about other unused symbols in
	/// the language like @? There should be a general design discussion about what identifiers should be valid.

	Minus,

	/// The number token type. Currently, Cabin only supports very clear decimal literals. It does not currently support binary literals, hex literals, scientific
	/// notation literals, octal literals, etc. Furthermore, unlike Rust, Cabin does not allow number literals with a decimal but no numbers after the decimal,
	/// nor does it allow decimal literals with no numbers proceeding the decimal. To be specific, all numbers in the value currently must match the given regular
	/// expression:
	///
	/// ```js

	Semicolon,

	/// The string token type. This is a double quoted string. In Cabin, all strings are formatted and multiline by default; However, the parsing of inlined formatted
